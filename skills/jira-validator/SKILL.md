# Skill: jira-validator

Resolves and validates the Jira ticket associated with the PR. Always runs as part of `/open-pr`.

## Inputs

- `-jira=<JIRAID>` option (optional)
- Current branch name (fallback source for ticket ID)

## Responsibilities

1. **Resolve ticket ID**:
   - If `-jira=<JIRAID>` provided: use it directly
   - Else: extract from branch name (e.g., branch `PROJ-1234` → ticket `PROJ-1234`)
   - If neither yields a valid ID: **block** and ask the user
2. **Validate format** — must match `<PROJECT>-<NUMBER>` (e.g., `PROJ-1234`)
3. **Verify accessibility** — the ticket must exist and be reachable; capture its summary, status, and assignee
4. **Status check** — warn (but do not block) if the ticket is `Done`/`Closed`; block if no ticket exists
5. **Capture summary** for downstream use in PR title/body

## Output

Append to `PR-MANIFEST.md` under `## Jira Validation`:

```markdown
