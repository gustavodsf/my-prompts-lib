# Skill: PR Manifest

Manages the `PR-MANIFEST.md` file used to coordinate output across the `/open-pr` sub-agents.

## Purpose

`PR-MANIFEST.md` is the **shared scratchpad** for a single `/open-pr` run. Sub-agents append their results to it; Phase 4 reads it to post the review comment.

## Lifecycle

| Phase | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Reset (delete + recreate) |
| 2 | Each agent appends its section |
| 3 | Not touched |
| 4 | Read `## Code Review` section to post as PR comment |

The file is reset every run — **never accumulated** across runs — and **never committed**.

## Phase 1 Steps

1. If `PR-MANIFEST.md` exists, delete it:
   ```bash
   rm -f PR-MANIFEST.md
   ```
2. Create it with a metadata header:
   ```markdown
   # PR Manifest

   - **Path**: <absolute-path-to-file>
   - **Created**: <ISO-8601-UTC-timestamp>
   - **Session**: <session-identifier>
   - **Branch**: <current-branch>
   ```
3. Ensure `.gitignore` contains `PR-MANIFEST.md`:
   ```bash
   grep -qxF 'PR-MANIFEST.md' .gitignore || echo 'PR-MANIFEST.md' >> .gitignore
   ```

## Section Marker Contract

Each agent **must** begin its appended output with one of these exact `##` headers:

| Agent | Header |
| --- | --- |
| `git-branch-validator` | `## Branch Validation` |
| `jira-validator` | `## Jira Validation` |
| `code-reviewer` | `## Code Review` |

Phase 4 extracts the code review by reading from `## Code Review` to end of file, so this header **must be unique** in the manifest and must appear **once**.

## Append Pattern

Agents append (never overwrite) using:

```bash
cat >> PR-MANIFEST.md <<'EOF'

## <Section Header>

<agent output...>
EOF
```
